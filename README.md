# STA9760_Project2_Yelp_Data_Analysis

### For this project, I will use Spark Cluster on AWS EMR for loading and running some analysis on Yelpâ€™s Reviews and Businesses dataset (about 10gb) from Kaggle and run your analysis via Jupyter Notebook. I pull this data into a publis s3 bucket: s3://Sta9760-yelpdata-yh/yelp_academic_dataset_business.json
